# Jarvis-Voice-Assistant---A-Python-Based-Virtual-Assistant

This Python project is a voice-activated virtual assistant named Jarvis, inspired by popular digital assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant. Jarvis can perform a variety of tasks, including:

- Opening popular websites like Google, Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram.
- Playing songs from a pre-defined music library.
- Fetching and reading out the latest news headlines.
- Processing general commands using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model.

## Key Features:
- **Speech Recognition**: Uses the `speech_recognition` module to listen and interpret voice commands.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Employs the `pyttsx3` library to provide vocal feedback to the user.
- **Web Automation**: Automates opening web pages using the `webbrowser` module.
- **AI Integration**: Integrates with OpenAI's API to handle more complex commands.

## Setup Instructions:
1. Ensure you have all required Python packages installed (`pyttsx3`, `speech_recognition`, `requests`, `webbrowser`, `openai`).
2. Replace the placeholder API keys with your actual keys.
3. Run the program and interact with Jarvis via voice commands.

## How to Use:
- Run the script, and Jarvis will prompt you to initialize.
- Once initialized, you can give commands like "Open Google", "Play [Song Name]", or ask for the latest news.
- To exit the program, simply say "exit".

## Note:
Ensure the `musicl_ibrary` module is properly defined and contains a dictionary of songs and their corresponding links.
